    <h1>Leng (Spicy Pork Back-Bone Stew)</h1>

    <p><img src="../images/leng.jpg"></a></p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Leng. Oh baby, Leng. A staple for me, morning or night, after 2 hours of tennis. Yes, it's 35 degrees, and yes it's 11 in the morning and I'm sitting 2 meters from a busy Sukhumvit already roaring with ungodly traffic that spits pollution like it's ripping through a bag of sunflower seeds, and yet leng hits the spot.</p>
    <p>Pork Rib bones in broth, dressed with more green and red thai chilis than a westerner's stomach can handle. And yet, the spice teases you, it brings you to the brink of "Oh shit here it comes!" and then it lingers on that fine wire like a trapeze swinger. 
        The spice floats in your mouth for a few minutes, never intensifying, invitingy you to take just one more bite. Maybe one more bite before the capsicin invokes a mutiny of your sweat glands. Nope, somehow, no matter how much chili you gulp down, it knows to not lose your trust. Just one more bite then...</p>

    <p>How long does it take to make? No F*cking idea. But it takes a blink to eat, I can tell you that.</p>
