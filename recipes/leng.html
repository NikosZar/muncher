    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <a href="https://www.pholfoodmafia.com/recipe/spicy-pork-back-bone-stew-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%8B%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%9A/" target="_blank" rel="nonopenner nonreferrer">Leng</a>. Oh baby, Leng. A staple for me, morning or night, after 2 hours of tennis. Yes, it's 35 degrees, and yes it's 11 in the morning and I'm sitting 2 meters from a busy Sukhumvit already roaring with ungodly traffic that spits pollution like it's ripping through a bag of sunflower seeds, and yet leng hits the spot.</p>
    <p>Pork Rib bones in broth, dressed with more green and red thai chilis than a westerner's stomach can handle. And yet, the spice teases you, it brings you to the brink of "Oh shit here it comes!" and then it lingers on that fine wire like a trapeze swinger. 
        The spice floats in your mouth for a few minutes, never intensifying, invitingy you to take just one more bite. Maybe one more bite before the capsicin invokes a mutiny of your sweat glands. Nope, somehow, no matter how much chili you gulp down, it knows to not lose your trust. Just one more bite then...</p>

    <p>How long does it take to make? No F*cking idea. But it takes a blink to eat, I can tell you that.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5kg Pork Back-Bone</li>
        <li>2 Large White Onions</li>
        <li>0.5 cups Thai Garlic</li>
        <li>5 Coriander Roots</li>
        <li>0.5 cups Thai Green Chili</li>
        <li>0.5 cups Thai Red Chili</li>
        <li>3 stems Lemon Grass</li>
        <li>10 Kaffir Lime Leaves</li>
        <li>Handful of Parsley</li>
        <li>6 tsp Dried Thai Red Chili Flakes</li>
        <li>0.5 cups Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Granulated Sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pork ribs with clean water to cover the pork ribs in a pressure cooker. Pound garlic and coriander root, add to the pot along with halved shallots, galangal and crushed lemongrass. Bring to a boil, skim off foam, then close the lid of the pressure cooker and boil for 40-45 minutes. When the time is up, adjust the pressure regulator to the on position and wait until there is no more steam coming out. Open the lid and return to the heat.</li>
        <li>Season with lime juice, fish sauce and sugar to taste. Put the garden chili in a blender and blend it. Add half of the chili and then add the kaffir lime leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve with the remaining chili, dried chili and chopped coriander.</li>
    </ol>
